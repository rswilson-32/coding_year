# coding language popularity by year

For this project, I compared the amount of tags per language as seen on Stack Overflow posts. By comparing yearly question flairs, we can visualize the varying popularity of languages over the years.

I used R, spefically dyplr and ggplot2 for this project. Dplyr was used for filtering the main dataset, and ggplot was used to visualize the trends.

Our data is from Stack Overflow question tags, from 2007 to mid 2017.

I learned how easy dplyr and ggplot2 are to use! These packages were great for filtering and ordering so many tags into simple, readable graphs.
